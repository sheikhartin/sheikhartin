### That‚Äôs Right, I‚Äôm Artin!

I am _very_ interested in **designing and implementing** useful and/or everyday software **from scratch to gain new and deep experiences**, and _maybe_ even improve them!

These are other bridges between you and me:

[ùïè](https://x.com/sheikhartin) ‚Ä¢ [Daftar (my self-hosted blog)](https://sheikhartin.pythonanywhere.com/) ‚Ä¢ [Telegram](https://telegram.me/sheikhartin) ‚Ä¢ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13414133/artin-mohammadi) ‚Ä¢ [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@artin-mohammadi/) ‚Ä¢ [Virgool](https://virgool.io/@sheikhartin) ‚Ä¢ [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sheikhartin) ‚Ä¢ [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/artin-mohammadi/)

A _possibly_ funny fact: When I tried to use my bot **to auto-delete things saved on LinkedIn, I got blocked**... And at least _I don't have access to it until I get my passport_!

#### Best Experiences

- This project is **for people who want to compare everything** in a playful and entertaining manner.\

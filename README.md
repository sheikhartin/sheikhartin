### That’s Right, I’m Artin!

I am _very_ interested in **designing and implementing** useful and/or everyday software **from scratch to gain new and deep experiences**, and _maybe_ even improve them!

These are other bridges between you and me:

[Telegram](https://telegram.me/sheikhartin) • [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13414133/artin-mohammadi) • [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@artin-mohammadi/) • [Virgool](https://virgool.io/@sheikhartin) • [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sheikhartin) • [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/artin-mohammadi/)

A _possibly_ funny fact: When I tried to use my bot **to auto-delete things saved on LinkedIn, I got blocked**... And at least _I don't have access to it until I get my passport_!

#### Best Experiences

- **Designing and implementing a programming language** _without_ using tools like [ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4), [PLY](https://github.com/dabeaz/ply), or any known tool to do so.\
  _Python, Git — [Link](https://github.com/sheikhartin/farr)_

- My second website was about **a platform where users could chat with other website members in real-time and show their knowledge by answering questions!**\
  _Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Bulma CSS, Git — [Link](https://github.com/sheikhartin/soalpich)_

- **A bytecode interpreter** _for mathematical expressions_. This project was made to better understand _bytecode virtual machines_ and _the damn Go programming language_!\
  _Go, Git — [Link](https://github.com/sheikhartin/bytecode-based-calculator)_

- To get **a deeper understanding of neural networks**, I decided to implement it _almost_ **from scratch**.\
  _Python, NumPy, Git — [Link](https://github.com/sheikhartin/notebooks-everywhere/blob/develop/Multilayer_Perceptron_From_Scratch.ipynb)_

- Implementation of the well-known SMA* algorithm **to find the shortest path**!\
  _Python, Git — [Link](https://github.com/sheikhartin/simplified-memory-bounded-a-star)_

- A web scraper **to extract data from all three different types of groups** from the **Google Scholar** website.\
  _Python, Git — [Link](https://github.com/sheikhartin/google-scholar-scraper)_

- A project for the **Computer Olympiad** where I had to specifically implement **a system to manage a store**.\
  _Python, SQLite, PyQt5, Git_

- I developed **a cryptocurrency trading bot** for the _ETH/USDT_ pair as _a high school internship project_.\
  _Python, Pandas, API, Git_
